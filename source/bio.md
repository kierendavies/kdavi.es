I am a native of [Cape Town, South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Town).  In 2014 I completed my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computer science at the [University of Cape Town](http://uct.ac.za/).  In 2016 I will resume studies for a BSc Honours degree.

I started programming when I was 15, after I heard about the [South African Computer Olympiad](http://www.olympiad.org.za/programming-olympiad/).  For the next few years I was hooked on contest programming, and I went on to place second in the olympiad in 2010.  Since then I have competed in the 2011 [International Olympiad in Informatics](http://www.ioinformatics.org/index.shtml) in [Pattaya, Thailand](http://www.ioi2011.or.th/), and the 2014 [ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest](http://icpc.baylor.edu/) world finals in [Yekaterinburg, Russia](http://www.icpc2014.ru/en).

I have done internships at several start-ups and small businesses in Cape Town, including [Praekelt Foundation](http://praekeltfoundation.org/), [Krit](http://krit.com/), and [SKA Africa](http://www.ska.ac.za/), as well as international companies [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/careers/locations/menlo-park), [Oracle (Nimbula)](http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/acquisitions/nimbula/index.html), and (currently) [Amazon Web Services](http://adccpt.co.za/).

I spend a lot of my free time playing League of Legends as [kierend](www.lolking.net/summoner/euw/61403871) on EUW.  I mainly play support and jungle.

The rest of the time I can be found rock climbing, playing paintball, or making sounds with my guitar and other instruments.
