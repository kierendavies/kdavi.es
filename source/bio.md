I am a native of [Cape Town, South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Town).  I completed my B.Sc. in Mathematics and Computer Science in 2014 at the [University of Cape Town](http://uct.ac.za/), and my B.Sc. (Hons.) in Computer Science in 2016.  My thesis was titled [_Towards Test-Driven Development of Ontologies: An Analysis of Testing Algorithms_](https://people.cs.uct.ac.za/~dvskie001/doc/TDD_Ontologies_Analysis_of_Testing_Algorithms.pdf), and a version of it will be published at the [2017 European Semantic Web Conference](http://2017.eswc-conferences.org/).

I started programming when I was 15, after I heard about the [South African Computer Olympiad](http://www.olympiad.org.za/programming-olympiad/).  For the next few years I was hooked on contest programming, and I went on to claim second place in the olympiad in 2010.  Since then I have competed in the 2011 [International Olympiad in Informatics](http://www.ioinformatics.org/index.shtml) in [Pattaya, Thailand](http://www.ioi2011.or.th/), and the [ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest](http://icpc.baylor.edu/) world finals in [2014 in Yekaterinburg, Russia](http://www.icpc2014.ru/en) and in [2017 in Rapid City, South Dakota, USA](http://www.icpc2017.org/).

I am currently a backend developer at [Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/) in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.  I have previously done internships at several start-ups and small businesses in Cape Town, including [Praekelt Foundation](http://praekeltfoundation.org/), [SKA Africa](http://www.ska.ac.za/), and [Jumo](http://jumo.world/), as well as international companies [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/careers/locations/menlo-park), [Oracle (Nimbula)](http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/acquisitions/nimbula/index.html), and [Amazon Web Services](http://adccpt.co.za/).

I spend most of my free time playing [League of Legends](http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/) and [Overwatch](https://playoverwatch.com/), rock climbing, cycling, or making sounds with whatever musical instrument is within reach.
